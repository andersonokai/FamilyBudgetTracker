## Troubleshooting

### Expenses not appearing
- Ensure you are logged in. The app stores expenses per user.
- Check the terminal output for any EF Core errors. Look for `INSERT` statements when adding an expense.
- Ensure `Data/app.db` exists and is writable.

### Cannot register or login
- Confirm migrations were applied (`dotnet ef database update`).
- Check `appsettings.json` for the correct connection string.

### Reports empty after adding expenses
- Verify the expenses were created for your user by checking the `Expenses` table in `Data/app.db` (use a SQLite viewer).
- Ensure the report month/year matches the expense date.

## FAQs
Q: Why can't I see other users' expenses?
A: Expenses are private and tied to your account. Each user sees only their own entries.

Q: Is data backed up?
A: Locally it's stored in SQLite. For production, deploy to Azure and use Azure SQL for reliability and backups.
